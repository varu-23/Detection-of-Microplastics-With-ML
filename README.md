# Detection of Microplastics Using ML
 Project focused on detecting microplastics using machine learning and incorporating a multimodal approach for enhanced prediction accuracy.

Scripts for the training, validation, and testing of the models are written in R. The project requires downloading RStudio and installing packages specialized to each model. The packages can be found in the models folder. 

The training, validation, and testing data can be found in the data folder.
